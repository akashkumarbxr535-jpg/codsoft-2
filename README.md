Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project!

This is a classic data science problem where we predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not based on various features like age, gender, passenger class, and more. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your data science skills, this project is a great way to dive into machine learning and predictive modeling. ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning tutorials and competitions and provides an excellent opportunity to apply classification algorithms.

Features:

Age: Age of the passenger

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Pclass: The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1, 2, 3)

Fare: The amount the passenger paid for the ticket

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic

Cabin: Cabin number (not always available)
